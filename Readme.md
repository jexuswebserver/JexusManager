Following the announcement at Jiaodong Developer Conference 2015 that Jexus Manager now becomes a fully open source project,
the code base has been cleaned up and published to GitHub.

More information about the code will be published in the coming weeks.

Documentation is at http://jexusmanager.com

Build from Source
=================
Make sure all Git submodules are initialized, and then run dist.deploy.bat to compile the source. It restores NuGet packages and kicks off MSBuild.
